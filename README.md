Starting September 2020, notebook items in course shells will become Ungraded Labs. Paid learners will be able to access their notebooks in the new Coursera lab environment; Auditors will lose access. We strongly encourage you to download your notebooks if you are auditing this course. You can also upgrade or applying for financial aid to access premium Lab items in your course.

Congratulations! Welcome to the fourth programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will now use everything you have learned to build a deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.

In the second exercise, you used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. Your algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! By completing this assignment, you will:

Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.

Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
